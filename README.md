# Neural Network
A neural network implemented from scratch designed in a way to make using it straight forward
## Usage
As shown by the MNIST example in neural_network.ccp you need to create a class inheriting from the Data class.
Then it's as simple as declaring a Network class and passing it as an argument then using the train method to train the network.
there are also save and load methods that allow for storing the network weights in a file
